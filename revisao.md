Reviewer Report
Relevance to the Journal and Current ICT-in-Education Context
Does the article address a topic of current concern aligned with the aims of the journal and the current state of ICT in education?
Yes. The article addresses a highly relevant and timely topic by examining how competition and need for cognition (NFC) interact to influence computational thinking (CT) outcomes and learning behaviors within digital game-based learning (DGBL) environments. These themes are strongly aligned with contemporary discussions in ICT in education, particularly regarding learner-centered design, motivational factors, and the pedagogical use of digital games. The study contributes to ongoing debates about how technological affordances and individual differences shape learning processes in digital contexts.

Abstract
Does the abstract give a clear account of the scope of the paper?
Largely yes. The abstract outlines the research purpose, key variables (competition, NFC, CT outcomes, learning behaviors), methodological approach, and main findings. However, it would benefit from greater conciseness and slightly more methodological specificity, particularly regarding the analytical techniques used (e.g., mediation analysis, lag sequential analysis). Reducing redundancy would further improve clarity.

Keywords
Do the keywords adequately reflect the paper?
Yes. The selected keywords accurately reflect the study's central constructs and focus, including computational thinking, digital game-based learning, competition, and need for cognition. They are appropriate for indexing and discoverability within the ICT in education research community.

Methodology
If the article concerns research activity, has a sound methodology been used and described?
Yes. The study employs a methodologically sound design that combines quantitative measures of CT outcomes and NFC with behavioral log data from a DGBL environment. The use of mediation analysis and lag sequential analysis is appropriate and well-justified. Minor clarifications are needed regarding the quasi-experimental nature of the design and aspects of validity (e.g., the justification for the assessment instruments). Still, overall, the methodology is robust and clearly described.

Distinction Between Opinion and Evidence
Does the article distinguish clearly between opinion and empirical evidence?
Yes. The manuscript consistently distinguishes between theoretical arguments, interpretations, and empirical findings. Results are presented systematically, and interpretations are generally grounded in the reported data. In a few places, particularly in the discussion, causal language could be softened to reflect the associative nature of the analyses better.

Contribution to Critical Understanding
Does the article contribute to a critical understanding of the issues?
Yes. The article contributes meaningfully to a critical understanding of how individual cognitive-motivational traits, such as NFC, interact with instructional design features, such as competition, in DGBL contexts. By modeling NFC as a mediating variable and incorporating behavioral sequence data, the study advances beyond surface-level outcome comparisons and deepens insight into learning processes.

Novelty and New Developments
Does the article alert readers to significant new developments in the subject area?
Yes. The integration of learning behavior sequence analysis with CT outcomes and motivational traits represents a valuable and relatively novel contribution. The differentiation of CT task difficulty levels by competition and NFC further strengthens the study’s originality and relevance.

Engagement with Contemporary Literature
Does the article take into account relevant contemporary literature in the area?
Yes. The literature review is comprehensive and engages with key contemporary sources on computational thinking, DGBL, competition, and the need for cognition. In some sections, synthesis could be strengthened by more explicitly comparing perspectives rather than listing studies, but the coverage itself is appropriate and up to date.

Referencing and Citation Style
Does the article clearly reference citations and quotations using the APA 7th edition?
Mostly yes. Citations generally follow APA 7th edition guidelines. However, there are minor inconsistencies in formatting and placeholder citations (e.g., anonymized author references) that should be resolved before final submission to ensure full compliance.

Clarity and Style
Is the article written in a clear and intelligible style for a reasonably well-informed international professional readership?
Overall, yes. The manuscript is understandable and logically structured. That said, the text would benefit from language polishing, particularly to address grammatical inaccuracies, awkward phrasing, and occasional redundancy. Improving flow and precision would enhance readability for an international audience.

CONFIDENTIAL COMMENTS FOR THE EDITOR
This manuscript presents a solid empirical contribution to the field of ICT in education, with clear relevance to the journal’s scope. The study is methodologically rigorous, theoretically grounded, and addresses an important gap concerning motivational mediation in digital game-based learning for computational thinking. While the paper requires moderate revisions—primarily related to language clarity, tightening of the abstract, minor methodological clarifications, and citation consistency—these issues are editorial rather than substantive. I believe the manuscript has strong potential for publication after revision and would recommend acceptance with minor to moderate revisions.
