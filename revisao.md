Reviewer Report
Relevance to the Journal and Current ICT-in-Education Context
Does the article address a topic of current concern aligned with the aims of the journal and the current state of ICT in education?
Yes. The article addresses a timely topic by examining how competition and need for cognition (NFC) interact to shape computational thinking (CT) outcomes and learning behaviors in digital game-based learning (DGBL). These themes align with current ICT-in-education debates on learner-centered design, motivation, and the pedagogical use of games. The study contributes to discussions on how technological affordances and individual differences influence learning in digital environments.

Abstract
Does the abstract give a clear account of the scope of the paper?
Largely yes. The abstract states the purpose, key variables (competition, NFC, CT outcomes, learning behaviors), methodological approach, and main findings. It would benefit from tighter wording and slightly more methodological specificity, particularly about the analytical techniques used (e.g., mediation analysis, lag sequential analysis). Reducing repetition would further improve clarity.

Keywords
Do the keywords adequately reflect the paper?
Yes. The keywords reflect the study's central constructs, including computational thinking, digital game-based learning, competition, and need for cognition. They are appropriate for indexing and discoverability within the ICT-in-education research community.

Methodology
If the article concerns research activity, has a sound methodology been used and described?
Yes. The study employs a sound design that combines quantitative measures of CT outcomes and NFC with behavioral log data from a DGBL environment. The use of mediation analysis and lag sequential analysis is appropriate and well justified. Minor clarifications are needed regarding the quasi-experimental nature of the design and validity evidence (e.g., justification for the assessment instruments). Overall, the methodology is robust and clearly described.

Distinction Between Opinion and Evidence
Does the article distinguish clearly between opinion and empirical evidence?
Yes. The manuscript consistently distinguishes between theory, interpretation, and empirical findings. Results are presented systematically, and interpretations are generally grounded in the data. In a few places, particularly in the discussion, causal language should be softened to reflect the associative nature of the analyses.

Contribution to Critical Understanding
Does the article contribute to a critical understanding of the issues?
Yes. The article contributes to a critical understanding of how cognitive-motivational traits such as NFC interact with instructional design features like competition in DGBL contexts. By modeling NFC as a mediator and incorporating behavioral sequence data, the study moves beyond surface-level outcome comparisons and deepens insight into learning processes.

Novelty and New Developments
Does the article alert readers to significant new developments in the subject area?
Yes. Integrating learning behavior sequence analysis with CT outcomes and motivational traits is a valuable and relatively novel contribution. Differentiating CT task difficulty levels by competition and NFC further strengthens the study's originality and relevance.

Engagement with Contemporary Literature
Does the article take into account relevant contemporary literature in the area?
Yes. The literature review engages with key contemporary sources on computational thinking, DGBL, competition, and need for cognition. In some sections, synthesis could be strengthened by more explicitly comparing perspectives rather than listing studies, but the overall coverage is appropriate and up to date.

Referencing and Citation Style
Does the article clearly reference citations and quotations using the APA 7th edition?
Mostly yes. Citations generally follow APA 7th edition guidelines. However, minor formatting inconsistencies and placeholder citations (e.g., anonymized author references) should be resolved before final submission to ensure full compliance.

Clarity and Style
Is the article written in a clear and intelligible style for a reasonably well-informed international professional readership?
Overall, yes. The manuscript is understandable and logically structured. That said, the text would benefit from language polishing to address grammatical inaccuracies, awkward phrasing, and occasional redundancy. Improving flow and precision would enhance readability for an international audience.

CONFIDENTIAL COMMENTS FOR THE EDITOR
This manuscript presents a solid empirical contribution to ICT in education and clearly fits the journal's scope. The study is methodologically rigorous, theoretically grounded, and addresses an important gap concerning motivational mediation in digital game-based learning for computational thinking. The paper requires minor-to-moderate revisions, primarily related to language clarity, abstract concision, minor methodological clarifications, and citation consistency; these are editorial rather than substantive. I recommend acceptance pending revision.
